    "# How to improve?\n",
    "Although the `StudentKnowingCrew` worked for a few questions, it was not sufficient to answer more general questions about PIRLS. This was due to the limited amount of information provided to the agents. To recap, we created this code:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "@agent\n",

    "            You know that there is the table Students with columns Stident_ID and Country_ID, and a table\n",
    "            Countries with column Country_ID, Name and Code.\n",

    "```\n",
    "We can see that our so-called 'database expert' only knows about two tables from our general PIRLS database: Students and Countries, which is a small section of what we actually have. Referring back to the tutorial on the data, we know that our database structure looks more like this:\n",

    "Seeing this clearly shows us how little our current solution understands about the structure of the database. We need a better solution - agents that know much more and can create more advanced queries. Enter the [`DataAnalysisCrew`](./src/submission/crews/basic_crew.py)!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference youâ€™ll notice is that the code is more complex. It now involves two agents: the data analyst and the data engineer. Another change is that we now have two static variables that point to two configuration YAML files, and the `DataAnalysisCrew` class has a wrapper called `@CrewBase`. These changes allow us to specify configurations for agents and tasks in separate YAML files and help declutter our code. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's take a look at our new agents. The data analyst has no tools to use. They only create results and analyze the data provided by the data engineer. The data engineer, on the other hand, has three tools and extensive knowledge of the database structure. Their task is to provide data that can help answer the question. Let's see what we can find in the  [agents.yaml](./src/submission/config/agents.yaml) file.\n",
