    "# **Tutorial 3** - Introduction to AI Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting to know the data, it's time to build our first generative AI solution. The skills you will learn here will have a tremendous impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into building our first GenAI solution, let's take a moment to understand what we're working with and why it's so exciting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Generative AI?\n",
    "Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that can create new content, ideas, or solutions. Unlike traditional AI that primarily analyzes existing data, GenAI can produce original text, images, code, or even music. The most common type of GenAI you might have heard of is Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT or Claude, which can generate human-like text based on the input they receive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why AI Agents?\n",
    "AI agents take GenAI a step further. An AI agent is like a virtual assistant with a specific role, expertise, and set of goals. It can use GenAI capabilities (like language models) to perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with humans or other AI agents.\n",
    "Learning about AI agents is valuable for your future work and projects because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Automation of Complex Tasks: AI agents can handle intricate, multi-step processes that previously required human intervention.\n",
    "- Enhanced Problem-Solving: By combining different AI agents with various expertise, you can tackle complex problems more efficiently.\n",
    "- Personalized Experiences: AI agents can adapt to individual user needs, creating more tailored solutions in fields like customer service, education, or healthcare.\n",
    "- Improved Decision-Making: In business and research, AI agents can process vast amounts of data to provide insights and recommendations.\n",
    "- Future-Proofing Your Skills: As AI continues to evolve, understanding how to work with and develop AI agents will be a crucial skill in our industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you'll learn how to build a *multi-agent system* using AWS Bedrock and [CrewAI](https://docs.crewai.com/). This hands-on experience will give you a strong foundation in working with AI agents, setting you up for success in this rapidly evolving field.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started by exploring the basics of AI agents and then move on to creating our own!"

    "## What are AI Agents? <a id='what-are-ai-agents'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents are like smart digital assistants with specific roles and goals. They use large language models (LLMs), to perform tasks, make decisions, and solve problems. Unlike simple chatbots or traditional AI systems that follow fixed rules, AI agents can adapt, learn, and work together to tackle complex challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's break down the key components of an AI agent system:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agents**: These are the core \"actors\" in our system. Each agent has:\n",
    "   - A specific role (e.g., \"Python Developer\" or \"Code Tester\")\n",
    "   - A set of skills or expertise\n",
    "   - Goals to achieve\n",
    "   - The ability to use tools and make decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Tools**: These are functions or capabilities that agents can use to perform tasks. Tools might include:\n",
    "   - Code execution engines\n",
    "   - Database query functions\n",
    "   - Web search capabilities\n",
    "   - Mathematical calculators\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Tasks**: These are the specific jobs or objectives assigned to agents. A task typically includes:\n",
    "   - A clear description of what needs to be done\n",
    "   - The expected output or result\n",
    "   - Any constraints or special instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Crew**: This is a group of agents working together to achieve a common goal. The crew concept allows for:\n",
    "   - Division of labor based on agent specialties\n",
    "   - Collaboration and information sharing between agents\n",
    "   - Coordinated problem-solving approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "AI agents differ from traditional LLMs in several ways:\n",
    "- They have specific roles and goals, rather than being general-purpose language processors\n",
    "- They can use external tools and resources to augment their capabilities\n",
    "- They can work together in teams (crews) to solve complex problems\n",
    "- They maintain context and can engage in multi-step problem-solving processes\n",
    "\n",
    "This system allows for powerful, flexible problem-solving capabilities that go beyond what a single AI model can achieve on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of good resources on the topic, e.g. the [LangChain Blog](https://blog.langchain.dev/langgraph-multi-agent-workflows/) or the official [CrewAI course](https://learn.crewai.com/)."

    "## Hello GenAI World <a id='hello-genai-world'></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into building complex AI agent systems, we need to start with the foundation: accessing and interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM). LLMs are the powerhouse behind our AI agents, providing the language understanding and generation capabilities that make our agents intelligent and versatile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Start with an LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Foundation of Intelligence**: LLMs form the cognitive core of our AI agents. They provide the language processing capabilities that allow agents to understand tasks, generate responses, and make decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Flexibility**: By starting with a raw LLM, we can understand its capabilities and limitations. This knowledge is crucial when we start designing our agents and their specific roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Customization**: Understanding how to interact with an LLM directly gives us the flexibility to customize our agents' behaviors and responses in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: As we build more complex systems, knowing how to efficiently interact with the LLM will be key to creating scalable solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll be using Amazon Bedrock, which provides access to various powerful LLMs. We'll specifically use the Claude 3 Haiku model. It's a great and cheap baseline model. Later you might want to add stronger models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet for more complex tasks.  The [Chatbot Arena](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard) is a great overview of the latest models and their respective strenghts."

    "## Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent arguments are used to define the characteristics and behavior of an agent in the Crew AI framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the `python_developer` agent, the following arguments are defined:\n",
    "- `role`: Specifies the role of the agent, which is \"Python developer\" in this case.\n",
    "- `backstory`: Provides a description of the agent's background and expertise. It states that the agent is an experienced Python developer with deep knowledge in Python programming.\n",
    "- `goal`: Defines the agent's goal, which is to write a Python code to solve the user's question.\n",
    "- `llm`: Specifies the language model to be used by the agent, which is an instance of the `ChatBedrock` class.\n",
    "- `allow_delegation`: Determines whether the agent can delegate tasks to other agents. In this case, delegation is not allowed.\n",
    "- `verbose`: Controls the verbosity level of the agent's output. It is set to `True` to enable verbose output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `tester` agent, the following arguments are defined:\n",
    "- `role`: Specifies the role of the agent, which is \"tester\".\n",
    "- `backstory`: In this case the agent is an experienced tester with deep knowledge in testing.\n",
    "- `goal`: Test the Python code to ensure it works correctly.\n",
    "- `llm`: `ChatBedrock` class.\n",
    "- `allow_delegation`: In this case, delegation is allowed. If the code does not pass the test, it will be re-delegated back to the Python developer agent.\n",
    "- `tools`: Specifies the tools that the agent can use. Agent can use tool if provided but doesn't have to, its up to his decision unless we explicitly order him to do so in `goal` or `backstory` In this case, the `eval_python_code` function is defined as a tool for the tester agent.\n",
    "- `verbose`: It is set to `True` to enable verbose output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check other agent attributes that may come useful [here](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Agents/).\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks can be defined as the steps an ai crew must take to accomplish a common goal. As LHMs (Large Human Models), we can recognize what steps must be taken in order for the task we define to be accomplished in the best possible way.\n",
    "Our example ai crew specializes in writing code for python, so what steps must be taken to write code for python?  Write code to python and test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `code_python_task` task, the following arguments are defined:\n",
    "- `description` : Short description of the task, for this task it is to write a python code. It also contains original task queried by user.\n",
    "- `expected_output` : Short description of expected output, here we can stabilize output to our expected form. For this task we want Python code that solves the task, python code only.\n",
    "- `agent` : Here we forward our previously defined `python_developer` agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `test_code_task` task, the following arguments are defined:\n",
    "- `description` : For this task we want our agent to test the code produced by `python_developer` agent.\n",
    "- `expected_output` : In this case results of testing.\n",
    "- `agent` : Here we forward our previously defined `tester` agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check other task attributes that may come useful [here](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Tasks/).\n",
    "## Crew\n",
    "\n",
    "In crew function we put all building blocks together and assemble our crew.\n",
    "- `agents` : Here we pass our agents, in this implementation framework automatically recognizes agent marked by `@agent` flag, using this flag adds object to global list of agents.\n",
    "- `tasks` : Similarly to agents, framework recognizes tasks marked by `@task` flag.\n",
    "- `process` : Here we define inference process. In our example we use `Process.sequential` where crew starts from task specified by us, in our example we defined `code_python_task` first so it will start from it. Another approach implemented by Crew AI framework is `Process.hierarchical`, you can read more about it here [Hierarchical Process](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/Hierarchical/#implementing-the-hierarchical-process).\n",
    "- `verbose` : Here we define verbosity for crew output.\n",
    "- `max_iter` : Here we define number of repetitions each agent can take in solving task. Changing this value has a great impact on balance between thoroughness and efficiency. Once the agent approaches this number, it will try its best to give a good answer.\n",
    "- `cache` : This argument specifies if crew will use cache to store output from tools. For example if tool produces large output like result of SQL queries, storing it in cache reduces load on external resources and speeds up the execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check other crew attributes that may come useful [here](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Crews/).\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are python functions that can be used by AI agents. They can perform a whole range of actions such as in this case executing python code, serving as a calculator or connecting to a database. These functions need to have a docstring so that agents can parse what input and output the function takes. These tools can be very general as in this case, or be directed to perform a strongly determined action such as executing a single SQL query. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation we mark our `eval_python_code` function with `@tool` flag to add it to tools list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more on crewAI tools [here](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Tools/#key-characteristics-of-tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "Now we can test our crew, feel free to play with it. (Just in case try to avoid asking for potentially dangerous code as this crew will execute it during testing)\n",
