    "# **Tutorial 3** - CrewAI Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "After getting to know the data, it's time to build our first generative AI solution. In this notebook, we will showcase how we can use the Langchain Bedrock API and build a Gen AI with Claude 3 Haiku. We will gain an understanding of how to use the crewAI framework to build multi-agent systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In GDSC, we encourage you to choose CrewAI over LangChain for its simplicity, but you are free to use [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/v0.2/docs/introduction/) if you prefer. CrewAI is user-friendly and ideal for task management and team collaboration. LangChain, on the other hand, offers more advanced features for developers looking to create complex applications. Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific needs and technical expertise.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will focus on CrewAI to help you get started quickly and easily.\n",
    "We recommend you to familiarize yourself with [CrewAI documentation](https://docs.crewai.com/).\n",

    "## What are AI agents \n",
    "AI agents are entities that interact with LLM (Language Model) APIs to generate text based on given prompts. These agents perform specific tasks and have defined roles, expertise, and goals. They can work together in either a sequential or hierarchical process to achieve a common goal, ensuring efficient and structured task completion.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a sequential process, agents collaborate by passing the output of one agent as the input to the next, creating a linear flow of information and actions. Each agent has a specific role and is assigned tasks related to that role. For example, in the code snippet below, we have two agents: a Python developer and a tester. The Python developer agent is responsible for writing Python code to solve the user's question, while the tester agent ensures the code works correctly. The chaining process starts with the Python developer agent writing the Python code based on the user's prompt. The output of this agent, which is the Python code, is then passed to the tester agent. The tester agent tests the code and provides the test results as the final output.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a hierarchical process, agents are organized in a tiered structure where higher-level agents oversee and coordinate the actions of lower-level agents. This allows for more complex task management and decision-making. Higher-level agents can delegate subtasks to lower-level agents and integrate their outputs into a cohesive solution. For instance, a project manager agent might oversee both the Python developer and tester agents, ensuring their tasks align with the overall project goals. The project manager agent can evaluate the final output, make necessary adjustments, and provide comprehensive feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "First, we need to import the required libraries and functions."

    "## Agents\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent arguments are used to define the characteristics and behavior of an agent in the Crew AI framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the `python_developer` agent, the following arguments are defined:\n",
    "- `role`: Specifies the role of the agent, which is \"Python developer\" in this case.\n",
    "- `backstory`: Provides a description of the agent's background and expertise. It states that the agent is an experienced Python developer with deep knowledge in Python programming.\n",
    "- `goal`: Defines the agent's goal, which is to write a Python code to solve the user's question.\n",
    "- `llm`: Specifies the language model to be used by the agent, which is an instance of the `ChatBedrock` class.\n",
    "- `allow_delegation`: Determines whether the agent can delegate tasks to other agents. In this case, delegation is not allowed.\n",
    "- `verbose`: Controls the verbosity level of the agent's output. It is set to `True` to enable verbose output.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `tester` agent, the following arguments are defined:\n",
    "- `role`: Specifies the role of the agent, which is \"tester\".\n",
    "- `backstory`: In this case the agent is an experienced tester with deep knowledge in testing.\n",
    "- `goal`: Test the Python code to ensure it works correctly.\n",
    "- `llm`: `ChatBedrock` class.\n",
    "- `allow_delegation`: In this case, delegation is allowed. If the code does not pass the test, it will be re-delegated back to the Python developer agent.\n",
    "- `tools`: Specifies the tools that the agent can use. Agent can use tool if provided but doesn't have to, its up to his decision unless we explicitly order him to do so in `goal` or `backstory` In this case, the `eval_python_code` function is defined as a tool for the tester agent.\n",
    "- `verbose`: It is set to `True` to enable verbose output.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check other agent attributes that may come useful [here](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Agents/).\n",
    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks can be defined as the steps an ai crew must take to accomplish a common goal. As LHMs (Large Human Models), we can recognize what steps must be taken in order for the task we define to be accomplished in the best possible way.\n",
    "Our example ai crew specializes in writing code for python, so what steps must be taken to write code for python?  Write code to python and test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `code_python_task` task, the following arguments are defined:\n",
    "- `description` : Short description of the task, for this task it is to write a python code. It also contains original task queried by user.\n",
    "- `expected_output` : Short description of expected output, here we can stabilize output to our expected form. For this task we want Python code that solves the task, python code only.\n",
    "- `agent` : Here we forward our previously defined `python_developer` agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the `test_code_task` task, the following arguments are defined:\n",
    "- `description` : For this task we want our agent to test the code produced by `python_developer` agent.\n",
    "- `expected_output` : In this case results of testing.\n",
    "- `agent` : Here we forward our previously defined `tester` agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check other task attributes that may come useful [here](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Tasks/).\n",
    "## Crew\n",
    "\n",
    "In crew function we put all building blocks together and assemble our crew.\n",
    "- `agents` : Here we pass our agents, in this implementation framework automatically recognizes agent marked by `@agent` flag, using this flag adds object to global list of agents.\n",
    "- `tasks` : Similarly to agents, framework recognizes tasks marked by `@task` flag.\n",
    "- `process` : Here we define inference process. In our example we use `Process.sequential` where crew starts from task specified by us, in our example we defined `code_python_task` first so it will start from it. Another approach implemented by Crew AI framework is `Process.hierarchical`, you can read more about it here [Hierarchical Process](https://docs.crewai.com/how-to/Hierarchical/#implementing-the-hierarchical-process).\n",
    "- `verbose` : Here we define verbosity for crew output.\n",
    "- `max_iter` : Here we define number of repetitions each agent can take in solving task. Changing this value has a great impact on balance between thoroughness and efficiency. Once the agent approaches this number, it will try its best to give a good answer.\n",
    "- `cache` : This argument specifies if crew will use cache to store output from tools. For example if tool produces large output like result of SQL queries, storing it in cache reduces load on external resources and speeds up the execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check other crew attributes that may come useful [here](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Crews/).\n",
    "## Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools are python functions that can be used by AI agents. They can perform a whole range of actions such as in this case executing python code, serving as a calculator or connecting to a database. These functions need to have a docstring so that agents can parse what input and output the function takes. These tools can be very general as in this case, or be directed to perform a strongly determined action such as executing a single SQL query. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this implementation we mark our `eval_python_code` function with `@tool` flag to add it to tools list.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more on crewAI tools [here](https://docs.crewai.com/core-concepts/Tools/#key-characteristics-of-tools).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Testing\n",
    "Now we can test our crew, feel free to play with it. (Just in case try to avoid asking for potentially dangerous code as this crew will execute it during testing)\n",

      "\n",
      "Final Answer:\n",
      "\n",
      "The 'solve_user_question' function should behave as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Prompt the user to enter a number:\n",
      "   - The function should use the built-in 'input()' function to prompt the user to enter a number.\n",
      "   - The prompt message should be clear and informative, such as \"Please enter a number: \".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Convert the user's input to an integer using the 'int()' function:\n",
      "   - The function should attempt to convert the user's input to an integer using the 'int()' function.\n",
      "   - If the user's input is a valid integer, the function should proceed to the next step.\n",
      "   - If the user's input is not a valid integer, the function should handle the 'ValueError' exception that will be raised by the 'int()' function.\n",
      "   - When a 'ValueError' is caught, the function should print an error message informing the user that the input is not a valid number, and prompt the user to enter a number again.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Calculate the square of the number using the '**' operator:\n",
      "   - After successfully converting the user's input to an integer, the function should calculate the square of the number using the '**' operator.\n",
      "   - The result of the calculation should be stored in a variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Print the result:\n",
      "   - The function should print the result of the square calculation to the console.\n",
      "   - The output should be formatted in a clear and readable way, such as \"The square of the number is: [result]\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Edge cases and additional requirements:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Handling very large or small numbers:\n",
      "  - The 'int()' function can handle a wide range of integer values, from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 on 32-bit systems, and even larger ranges on 64-bit systems.\n",
      "  - If the user enters a number that is too large or too small to be represented as an integer, the 'int()' function will raise an 'OverflowError' exception.\n",
      "  - The function should handle this exception and provide a clear error message to the user, informing them that the number is out of the valid range.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Handling non-numeric input:\n",
      "  - If the user enters a non-numeric value, such as a string or a floating-point number, the 'int()' function will raise a 'ValueError' exception.\n",
      "  - The function should handle this exception and provide a clear error message to the user, informing them that the input is not a valid number.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Handling empty input:\n",
      "  - If the user presses Enter without entering any value, the 'input()' function will return an empty string.\n",
      "  - The function should handle this case and provide a clear error message to the user, informing them that they need to enter a number.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Handling whitespace input:\n",
      "  - If the user enters a string that contains only whitespace characters (e.g., spaces, tabs, newlines), the 'int()' function will raise a 'ValueError' exception.\n",
      "  - The function should handle this case and provide a clear error message to the user, informing them that they need to enter a valid number.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, the 'solve_user_question' function will provide a robust and user-friendly experience, handling various input scenarios and providing clear error messages to the user.\u001b[0m\n",

      "The 'solve_user_question' function should behave as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Prompt the user to enter a number:\n",
      "   - The function should use the built-in 'input()' function to prompt the user to enter a number.\n",
      "   - The prompt message should be clear and informative, such as \"Please enter a number: \".\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Convert the user's input to an integer using the 'int()' function:\n",
      "   - The function should attempt to convert the user's input to an integer using the 'int()' function.\n",
      "   - If the user's input is a valid integer, the function should proceed to the next step.\n",
      "   - If the user's input is not a valid integer, the function should handle the 'ValueError' exception that will be raised by the 'int()' function.\n",
      "   - When a 'ValueError' is caught, the function should print an error message informing the user that the input is not a valid number, and prompt the user to enter a number again.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Calculate the square of the number using the '**' operator:\n",
      "   - After successfully converting the user's input to an integer, the function should calculate the square of the number using the '**' operator.\n",
      "   - The result of the calculation should be stored in a variable.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Print the result:\n",
      "   - The function should print the result of the square calculation to the console.\n",
      "   - The output should be formatted in a clear and readable way, such as \"The square of the number is: [result]\".\n",
      "\n",
      "Edge cases and additional requirements:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Handling very large or small numbers:\n",
      "  - The 'int()' function can handle a wide range of integer values, from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 on 32-bit systems, and even larger ranges on 64-bit systems.\n",
      "  - If the user enters a number that is too large or too small to be represented as an integer, the 'int()' function will raise an 'OverflowError' exception.\n",
      "  - The function should handle this exception and provide a clear error message to the user, informing them that the number is out of the valid range.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Handling non-numeric input:\n",
      "  - If the user enters a non-numeric value, such as a string or a floating-point number, the 'int()' function will raise a 'ValueError' exception.\n",
      "  - The function should handle this exception and provide a clear error message to the user, informing them that the input is not a valid number.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Handling empty input:\n",
      "  - If the user presses Enter without entering any value, the 'input()' function will return an empty string.\n",
      "  - The function should handle this case and provide a clear error message to the user, informing them that they need to enter a number.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Handling whitespace input:\n",
      "  - If the user enters a string that contains only whitespace characters (e.g., spaces, tabs, newlines), the 'int()' function will raise a 'ValueError' exception.\n",
      "  - The function should handle this case and provide a clear error message to the user, informing them that they need to enter a valid number.\n",
      "\n",
      "By following these guidelines, the 'solve_user_question' function will provide a robust and user-friendly experience, handling various input scenarios and providing clear error messages to the user.\n",
