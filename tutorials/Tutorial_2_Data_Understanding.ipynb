    "Welcome in the next part of our tutorials for Global Data Science Challenge 2024. Today, we embark on a comprehensive exploration of our dataset for this year's GDSC, featuring the PIRLS 2021 dataset.\n",
    "A solid understanding of the data is arguably the most important part of *any* data science project. The impact of data on the final results is usually higher than the impact of the choice of algorithm. The [data-centric AI](https://datacentricai.org/) is a great start to get deeper into the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial is structured into three primary components: a video, a website, and this notebook. To begin, I recommend watching the [PIRLS 2021 video](https://youtu.be/jUv1QowWmqI?feature=shared), which provides a solid foundation on what this study encompasses. Following the video, visit the [PIRLS 2021 website](https://pirls2021.org/) to delve deeper and discover additional information about the study. After engaging with these resources, you'll be well-prepared to navigate through this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "*If you're not watching our tutorial video and you are only reading this notebook, now is the perfect time watch [PIRLS 2021 video](https://youtu.be/jUv1QowWmqI?feature=shared) and browse through [PIRLS 2021 website](https://pirls2021.org/). Completing these steps is crucial for a thorough understanding of the study, which, in turn, will enhance your ability to follow along with the notebook. I strongly encourage you to familiarize yourself with the study before proceeding, to ensure a smooth and informed learning experience.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the GDSC is to build AI agents that automatically answer complex questions about educational topics, utilizing the PIRLS 2021 data. \n",
    "This notebook is crafted to showcase the complexity of SQL queries that LLMs (Large Language Models) will ingeniously construct to navigate the dataset's depths. Moreover, it's designed to empower you with strategies for independently discovering the data you find most compelling. By illustrating both the advanced SQL capabilities required by LLMs and guiding you on how to embark on your data exploration journey, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of effective query formulation."

    "Moving on to the next segment, we're diving into students' achievement scores. The twist here is that we're focusing on reading scores instead of questionnaire answers. The setup is pretty similar to what we've seen before. In the `StudentScoreEntries` table, you'll find the **Code** for each score, the **Name** of the score, and a **Type** field that gives you extra clues to pinpoint the scores you're really interested in. Over in the `StudentScoreResults` table, there's also a **Code**, which tells you which score the result belongs to. To uniquely identify records in this table, you'll need to use a combo of **Student_ID** and the score **Code**. And, of course, there's the **Score** field that shows the actual score.\n",

This score places students within the High International Benchmark category, indicating a strong performance in reading comprehension on a global scale. However, a noticeable long left tail extends towards scores close to zero, highlighting that a subset of students performed poorly. Turns out that there are many student who performed worse than student 51250010201 from the previous example.\n"

It's pretty cool to see that each country has its own unique pattern going on. This tells us that students in these places are experiencing education differently, maybe because of how schools do things or how much students get into their studies. Diving deeper into what makes each country's scores tick could shed some light on what's working (or not) in their education systems.\n",

For 'North Macedonia', the median score is slightly below the Intermediate Benchmark, indicating a moderate performance overall. In 'Abu Dhabi', the distribution of scores is bimodal, suggesting the presence of two distinct groups of students: one achieving scores at the level of the High International Benchmark and the other significantly below the Low International Benchmark. The poorest performing country is 'Morocco', with its median score falling below the Low International Benchmark, highlighting a need for targeted educational support and interventions to improve student outcomes.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Question Analysis** - Begin by thoroughly reading the question. Reflect on its core objectives and the specific information it seeks from the database. Understanding the question's essence is crucial for determining the direction of your query.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Table Selection** - Once you have a clear understanding of the question, identify where the required information resides within the database. Determine which tables contain the relevant data and consider how they might need to interact to provide the answers you're looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Query Development** - With the target tables identified, you can now focus on constructing the query. This step involves selecting the appropriate fields, specifying conditions, and possibly joining tables to extract the desired information. Depending on your proficiency with SQL, you may choose to build your query incrementally, testing each part as you go, or you might draft it in one go if you're more experienced.\n",

This result is then multiplied by 100 to convert it into a percentage format. The calculation involves a join between two previously defined CTEs: `schools_all` and `schools_closed`. The join is made on the country name (`A.Name = CL.Name`), ensuring that the calculation is done per country.\n",
