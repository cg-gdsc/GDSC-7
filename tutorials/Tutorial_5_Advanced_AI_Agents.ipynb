    "The main difference youâ€™ll notice is that the code is more complex. It now involves 2 agents: the data analyst and the data engineer.

    "Another important thing to pay attention to are the tools given to the data engineer agent. They can be found in the [src/submission/tools/database.py](../src/submission/tools/database.py). You may already be familiar with one of the functions because it was used by our previous `BasicPIRLSCrew`. The other two are quite similar to each other, and their main goal is to reduce the responsibility of generating SQL queries by the AI agents and instead provide them with a straightforward way to use predefined queries. These two tools focus on the questionnaire part of the database. If we take a closer look, we can see that there are a few similar tables, with the main difference being the context of the questions asked in the questionnaires.
